		  	<h4> By Tricia Shullick</h4>
			  <h5> Published 10/14/2018</h5>
			  
 <p>Everyone goes through their own shit. Nowadays, there’s been a greater voicing of mental illness and awareness of it. It is so much more common for young people to be exposed to this stigma, but there has been a breaking of said stigma, much of that is thanks to music. Twenty One Pilots is one band that doesn’t shy away from being honest about what it is like to deal with depression, anxiety, and other mental illnesses. Their new album, “Trench” dives deeper into their development as a band, and as humans struggling with mental illness. </p>

<p>The put out an EP with 4 of the new songs earlier this year, revealing the new color, yellow. Along with it, was a series of music videos showing the transition into the new phase for the band. The new album was released at the beginning of October. They did not disappoint. The album has several themes I have seen. One is being there for those struggling, and those your love. Another is overcoming despite your surroundings. Let’s go song by song. </p>

<p>The opening song is Jumpsuit. “Blurryface” had a motif of a face mask and a covered neck. This time around, it’s a jumpsuit with yellow trimming. The song goes into the struggle Tyler, the lead singer, has with the pressures of a new place, which insinuates the fame he attained from the success of the former album. The next song is Levitate. This song goes into how someone can rise up through the “cowards” and “curse of others.” Ultimately, its about overcoming and succeeding despite the disdain from others. The we have Morph, a much different vibe. Its about becoming someone else under pressure and losing yourself as a defense mechanism. This Portugal-the-man vibe song is very different compared to their older work, but a great addition to this album. Then we get into My Blood. What a jam, a song about being their for a brother. Who doesn’t love it. Then Chlorine. What. A. BOP. Music as a drug is the premise, and it’s one of the most effective drugs if you ask me. Smithereens is number 6 and it’s another song about being there for someone you love. This slower song describes the kind of love where you would sacrifice for the other person. Then we get into Neon Gravestones in which the narrator discusses the recent glorification of suicide in our society recently. It’s become a glorified escape to young people nowadays, and Tyler discusses the need to celebrate those who live, and remember those who have gone, but not glorify how they left. The next song is The Hype, and it’s another different sound for the band. This sound is about overcoming. A great follow-up song to Neon Gravestone. It touches on both external and internal sources of stress and pain. The hype refers to the falsities we tell ourselves or that others inflict on us, in the end we need to not believe what is said. We need to follow the truth. Next we have Nico and the Niners. An amazing tune that will be stuck in your head for days. Another song about overcoming despite the odds and despite your location or those in charge. Cut my lip is the next song and it falls under the overcoming category, but also goes into being there for someone else. Even though it hurts the person, they don’t mind being there for the other person. Bandito, a song about contemplation on which way to go upon their mission. This slower tech sounding song is much difference compared to the rest of the album, though the message fits with the theme of the story being told throughout the album. Then we get Pet Cheetah. This arguable one of the best songs on the album. Its quite the banger. The song was written to help Tyler overcome writers block, and clearly a pet cheetah names Jason was all he needed. Legend is a classic sounding boppy song with a twenty one pilots twist. It is about Tyler’s grandpa, who passed away while they were working on the album. The final song on the album is called Leave the City. While it’s about the narrator leaving the metaphorical city, it goes deeper. Its about the mental illnesses he is dealing with. He has his fans who feel the same way he does and they are able to get it. They are in the trench with his, and his battle is not solo. </p>

<p>Overall, great album. Great messages. 10/10 recommend. </p>
