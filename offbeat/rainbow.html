		  	<h4> By Tricia Shullick</h4>
			  <h5> Published 10/10/2018</h5>
			  
  <p> Theatrical, poetic, rainbow, kitten, and surprise are five words that most people would not put in the same sentence, especially when talking about a rock concert. However, when you put it in the context of the band Rainbow Kitten Surprise, all of those words go together seamlessly. </p>

 <p>  I had the opportunity recently to attend “The Friend, Love, and Freefall Tour” in Pittsburgh this past Monday. As a fan of the band, I was beyond excited to finally get to see them live. The show started with opener Caroline Rose. The stage was covered in red accoutrements. As the quirkily cooler-than-I’ll-ever-be musicians took the stage, the bops began. Now I wasn’t familiar with this eclectic artist before the show, but after Caroline introduction of their rubber chicken, Blarbra, and a tear-jerking recorder rendition of my heart with go on, I was an instant fan. Definitely recommend. </p>

<p>  After Rose in red, the awaited Rainbow Kitten Surprise took the stage.  The iron kings began with a song for the living. Fever Pitch is a crowd pleaser that will make every soul bop and make every fan ecstatic. Now, I was fortunate enough to have made it to the second row. That means I was able to see the expression on Charlie’s face during Moody Orange. I was able to watch Derrick harmonize with same to perfection. I got to see their interactions and their emotion to every song. </p>

<p>  For me, the highlight of the night was First Class. To give you a reference of how much I love this song, there was a solid 48 hours where it was the ONLY song I listened to, and I still listen to it several times a week. It’s my favorite song to belt when I’m alone… or with people… It’s just a great tune. Now the recorded version of the song is much melancholier. The live version was a bit more folky and a little more upbeat. That doesn’t mean I wasn’t crying the whole time, but that’s for a different discussion. </p>

<p>  The whole set-list was filled with amazing songs, all theatrically performed. The whole experience was one of the best concert experiences I’ve ever had. The way each member of the band was truly and uniquely themselves and create beautifully harmonized music filled with messages of struggle, heartbreak, and life. Though Rainbow Kitten Surprise sounds like they’d be playing weird children’s music, but that couldn’t be more wrong. You truly don’t know what you’re missing until you listen to their lyrics and dynamic sound. Their live performance was just as impactful and just as vulnerable as their recorded sound. Overall, this show was one that is highly recommended and one that I will remember for a lifetime  </p>
