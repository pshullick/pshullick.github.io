	<p>Hotel Contempo is the perfect spot for a gathering of modern artists. We <span class="underline">strongly recommend</span> you stay here for optimal participation in the conference.</p>

	<p>However, for those who opt to stay at another location, there is certainly no shortage of hotels in Downtown Seattle. As a local tour guide mentioned, <q>Seattle features hotels ranging from shabby chic to the ultimate in sophistication - there is a something to suit everyoneâ€™s taste.</q> </p>
