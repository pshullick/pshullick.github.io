	<h3>Tuesday, March 6, 2012</h3>

	<p>"Water in Art" is the theme for the second day, as art students from around the world gather at the Fountain of Intrigue in the gardens of <a href="http://www.hotelcontempo.com" target="blank">Hotel Contempo</a> to create ice sculptures, and art lecturers discuss the use of water as an art material, and water as an art subject.</p>

	<h4>Water in Art Kickoff Session</h4>
	<h5>09:30-10:30am: Elizabeth Hall </h5>
	<p>Jennifer Jerome, a native of New Orleans, whose work has centered around abstract images that depict flooding and rebuilding, will talk about how the floods inspired her artistically, and how, despite the sadness of devastation and lives lost, her work also depicts the hope and togetherness of a community that has persevered. </p>
